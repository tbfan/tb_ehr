# Tidy Bay eHR forked from the project lh-ehr-laravel-port
This project is to manage my and my family's personal medical records.
The lh-ehr-laravel-port project is located at: https://github.com/LibreHealthIO/lh-ehr-laravel-port

LibreHealth EHR is a free and open-source electronic health records and medical practice management application.
 
The mission of LibreHealth is to help provide high quality medical care to all people, regardless of race, socioeconomic status, or geographic location, by providing medical practices and clinics across the globe access to free of charge medical software.

That same software is designed to save clinics both time and money, which gives practitioners more time to spend with individual patients, thereby supplying patients with higher quality care.

We are current and former contributors to OpenEMR and thank that community for years of hard work. We intend to honor that legacy by allowing this new community to leverage the good things in OpenEMR, share what we create and not be afraid to break backward compatibility in the name of forward progress and modern development models.

This repository carries the new code base for the EHR application. The new code base is based on the Laravel framework because it has standards that will enable contributors to easily understand code written by others. The modular approach is used in developing this new EHR application with Laravel's laravel-module package.

We are collaborating closely with the [LibreHealth Project](http://LibreHealth.io), an umbrella organization for health IT projects with similar goals.
